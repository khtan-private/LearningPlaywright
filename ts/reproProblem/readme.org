* Q) Have problems running tests in folder outside playwright directory
In the description of the cli, https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli, I can specify a test directory independently
with -c {dir} or --config {dir}: Directory with the tests to run without configuration file.

In this reproProblem folder, I have the Playwright setup in "pw4" and the tests in "pw4tests/tests".
There are local test directories 'pw4/test', 'pw4/test2', and one outside the repo folder '../pw4tests/tests'

The tree command shows this in a better way : 

c:\cprojects\github\khtan-private\LearningPlaywright\ts\reproProblem>tree /f .

In all cases, I use both --config {file} to point to the configuration file and --config {dir} to point to the
test directory.
