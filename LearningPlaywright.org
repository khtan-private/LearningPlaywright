** intent
One intent is to use decentralized note taking. In this case, much of the notes would not make sense without
the source and repo, so might as well put the documentation here.
Since this is Git-based, there is no need to link to this file, just have to clone the repo.

The high level folders js and ts are intended to identify the languages ( javascript, typescript ). This makes
the repo scalable to future languages like cs, python etc. 

It may be useful to create a descriptive link to each of the folders, after things are known.
